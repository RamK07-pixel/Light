This is because there are two chromium atoms present in the compound, each with an oxidation state of +6, leading to a total oxidation state of +12 for the chromium atoms. However, since K2Cr2O7 is an ionic compound, the charge must be balanced. The potassium ions (K+) have a charge of +1, and there are two potassium ions for each chromium atom, resulting in a total charge of +2 from the potassium ions. To balance the charge, the total oxidation state of the chromium atoms must be -2 times the charge of the potassium ions, which is -2*(+1) = -2. Therefore, the oxidation state of each chromium atom is +6/2 = +3. Since there are two chromium atoms, the total oxidation state of chromium in K2Cr2O7 is +6.",
